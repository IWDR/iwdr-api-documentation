                    Documentation, mapping tools etc will be provided after IWDR/CGS acceptance of this application and
                    mutually positive decision to move forward after the intial discussion with your team.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your team will complete the mapping process.

                    IWDR/CGS will provide support as needed however until the date we have committed to start actively
                    working on your dataset, our response time will vary based on other work commitments.

                    After the initial explanation regarding this task and how to use the online documentation, I will be
                    charged and hourly fee based on $125 USD/hour for work done by IWDR/CGS.

                <li>
                    If we do not have the internal resources for mapping, the start time for your project will be
                    delayed by IWDR/CGS.

                <li>
                    I understand that data inaccuracies or errors within the dataset will delay any agreed upon dates or
                    estimations, depending on the time it takes my organization to cleanse the data, IWDR/CGS may need
                    to extend the timeframe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I understand that errors in your mapping will result in errors or raw data and pedigrees will
                    negatively impact acurracy of your results on EBV, inbreeding coeffiicient, generation coefficients
                    and other possible important data points.
