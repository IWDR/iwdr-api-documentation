            <ol>
                <li>
                    The International Working Dog Breeding Association, hereinafter referred to
                    as IWDBA, was incorporated under State of Texas, United States of America,
                    law on May 12, 2004.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The IWDBA was recognized by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of
                    Treasury, United States Government as a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity on
                    April 19, 2007.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The International Working Dog Registry, hereinafter referred to as IWDR, is
                    wholly and completely owned by IWDBA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For purposes of this agreement, phenotype data are defined as any physical
                    or biological measurement made on an individual dog.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A cooperative is defined as a group of working dog organizations or a group
                    of private breeders who have agreed to work together. The group’s
                    cooperation usually takes the form of
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Data Cooperative, where the members pool data on all their dogs into one
                        centralized database for the purpose of improving the accuracy of
                        prediction for genetic merit with respect to a particular trait or
                        phenotype, or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Breeding Cooperative, where the members agree to pool their genetic
                        resources by placing them under control of one overall breeding program
                        manager, who then makes all breeder selection decisions and all mating
                        decisions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The IWDR has been designed from the outset to support both types of
                cooperatives.
                <li>
                    The purpose of IWDR is to gather into one central electronic repository all
                    relevant phenotype data on a large number of dogs. Many dogs may be related
                    by virtue of having ancestors in common. These common ancestors may be
                    identified by traditional pedigrees or by genomic information derived from
                    analysis of DNA. Pedigrees are defined as specific identification in a coded
                    format to identify an exact dog as the sire and an exact bitch as the dam of
                    each individual offspring. When the parents of an individual dog cannot be
                    identified, those parents will be recorded as “unknown” or “missing” in the
                    database, unless the presence of DNA-derived information otherwise provides
                    incontrovertible proof of the identity of an otherwise unknown parent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data stored in the IWDR central electronic repository will be used to
                    calculate an estimated breeding value, hereinafter known as an EBV, which,
                    for a specific phenotype, is a statistical prediction of relative genetic
                    merit for each individual dog as a potential parent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Associated with each EBV is a corresponding accuracy level, which reflects
                    the amount of information available from both pedigree and phenotypes to
                    make the stated prediction. Accuracy values associated with each EBV will be
                    published in the database, alongside the phenotype data recorded on each
                    individual dog.
                </li>
                <li>
                    IWDR, as an organizational entity, will offer no opinion about the
                    suitability of using any particular dog or bitch as a parent for producing a
                    new litter. Interpretation and use of EBVs is solely the responsibility of
                    each organization that controls the welfare of a particular dog.
                </li>
                <li>
                    IWDR is a “crowd-sourced” database, which means that all data entered into
                    the system are placed there by end-users. This also means that all
                    responsibility for the accuracy of each data item entered into the system
                    rests with the person or organization who made the entry, and NOT with the
                    IWDR dog owner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    IWDR pledges that, to the best of its ability, the system will be operated
                    using best operational management practices, including, but not limited to,
                    the use of standard backup policies that keep a daily backup copy of the
                    database on-site for at least 30 days. An additional backup copy of the
                    database will be kept in an alternate storage service in the “cloud” that is
                    owned and operated by a vendor who is completely separate and independent
                    from the primary cloud-service provider.
                </li>
                <li>
                    IWDR pledges that, to the best of their ability, its managers will use
                    internationally recognized best practice procedures and software for
                    completing the statistical calculations required to produce EBVs. Terms
                    included in each statistical model fitted for a particular trait will be
                    clearly defined and published on the IWDR website at: https://www.iwdr.org/.
                </li>
                <li>
                    IWDR acknowledges that all data entered by a user group entity (referred to
                    as &quot;entity&quot;, whether it be an organization or IWDR dog owner) through any
                    user accounts associated with the &quot;entity&quot;, database administrators or
                    previous owners, is the sole property of that &quot;entity&quot;.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Persons or organizations choosing to enter data into IWDR do so with the
                    understanding that the entity recorded as the “owner” of a dog has editing
                    rights to enter and modify data stored about the individual dog.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unless provided by a duly executed exception managed by the IWDR software
                    system, only the currently recorded first or primary owner of a dog will be
                    enabled by the system to enter new phenotype measurements on an individual
                    dog.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All IWDR users from working dog organizations can view data available in the
                    All Dogs tab. This includes abnormal and normal phenotypes for common health
                    screening tests for any dog in the IWDR database including other working dog
                    organizations and private breeders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users from non-working dog entities can view data available in their breed’s
                    tab. This includes normal phenotypes for common health screening tests for
                    dogs that are not owned by working dog organizations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Owners have the option to share private phenotype data with a selected
                    &quot;entity&quot; using IWDR. This option can be rescinded at the sole discretion of
                    the owner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only an authorized employee of an organization should release information on
                    an individual dog to a larger audience than the employees of the
                    organization. Tools available on the database website will enable IWDR users
                    associated with the &quot;entity&quot; to release the information. An
                    entity-associated user who releases IWDR information to a wider audience
                    accepts full responsibility for any consequences that might develop as a
                    result of his or her action to release that information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The display of EBVs on individual dogs will be limited according to the
                    following rules:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When the primary owner of a dog is a member of a cooperative, EBVs for
                        that dog will be displayed according to terms specified by the
                        cooperative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the primary owner of a dog is not a member of a cooperative, EBVs
                        will be displayed only to the currently recorded owner(s) and the breeder
                        of a dog, unless the primary owner takes additional action to release EBVs
                        to a wider audience of IWDR users.
                    </li>
