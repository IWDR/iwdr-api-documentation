# Authentication
<AuthChecker />

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the IWDR API endpoints. Currently there is only one
method of authentication for the IWDR API, and that is Token based authentication. {{className: 'lead'}}

## Using token authentication

The token authentication system is fairly simple, you will use a securely generated string passed as an HTTP header
value to authenticate your HTTP requests. Here's an example of how to authenticate using cURL:

```bash {{title: 'Example request with token auth header'}}
curl https://iwdr.org/iwdr/api/v1.php?table=table&action=action \
-H "X-Auth-Token: assigned_api_token"
```

<Note>
    Please ensure that you don't commit your assigned IWDR API Token to GitHub, or
    any other similar repository sharing platform! This will compromise the tokens
    identity, and could result in your organizations data becoming publicly
    available.
