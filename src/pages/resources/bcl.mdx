# Behavior Checklists

The Behavior Checklist (BCL) is a behavior scoring system developed by Dr. James Serpell from the University of
Pennsylvania, USA in collaboration with multiple guide dog organizations especially The Seeing Eye and Guiding Eyes
for the Blind.
The BCL provides a way to describe aspects of behavior important for guide and service dogs. Importantly the BCL has
been validated and demonstrates the capacity to measure behavior in a consistent manner that lends itself to
analysis.

## The Behavior Checklist Model

The behavior checklist model is IWDR's representation of the checklist originally developed by Dr. James Serpell.

- **API Endpoint**: tblDogBehaviorChecklist
- **Available Actions**: list, create, update
