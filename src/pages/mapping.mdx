# Mapping

Mapping is the process of exporting your organization's data structures into a set of structured tables within the IWDR interface.
This is accomplished by matching the values from iwdr to the appropriate values your organization is planning to
send via API requests.

Each model available via the IWDR api will more likely than not require a multitude of mappings to be completed.
Your team will need to review and manage its mapping records frequently to ensure there are no inaccuracies or
anomalies.

The IWDR team will also periodically review your mapping records because we need mapping to be accurate
(particularly the critical data fields) while your organization continues to use the IWDR API.
