# Mapping
<AuthChecker />

Mapping is the process
of translating your organization's values into a set of structured key/value pairs using the IWDR interface.
Your organization will translate the coded values from within the iwdr interface to the appropriate cooresponding values
being submitted by your organization's varying API requests.

## Responsibilites

Each menu item/details tab,
also known as "resource" throughout this documentation, has specific fields, or columns, that need to be mapped.
These mappings will then be querired against whenever an API request is attempting to create/update a record
in order to translate the received data into meaningful values for IWDR.

<Note alert>
    Your team must populate, review, and update your own mappings. For the sake of data integrity,
    your organization must update mapping changes as soon as they occur within your organization's database.
    This will ensure that records being submitted via API requests remain synchronus to your organization's database.
</Note>

<Note>
    The IWDR team will perform intitial, along with periodic, review of your organization's mappings,
    so that we can better answer any API-related questions.
</Note>


## Example mappings from IWDR

This table shows an example mapping row, [from the IWDR interface top level menu](https://iwdr.org/iwdr/login.php) (Admin -> Manage our lists -> API -> API Mappings),
of the dog resource column **dog_BreedCode** value **"Golden Retriever"**
to your organization's dog breed code value **"4"**.

<Note>
    Not all mapping records need to populated. You only need to supply a mapping for values which apply to
    your organization's data.
</Note>

### Mapping Column Explanations
1. **IWDR Key**: This column is a non-editable, exact display, of the text shown throughout the IWDR interface.
2. **Your outside Key**: This column is editable, and it's where your organization must input the appropriate matching value(s) being passed in through API requests. You can input either a single value, or a comma seperated list of values.
3. **Notes**: This editable column is used internally amongst your organization. It can be helpful specifying the meaning of certain coded values.
4. **IWDR Table Name**: This column is non-editable, and used internally for IWDR's purposes.
5. **IWDR Code**: This column is non-editable, and used internally for IWDR's purposes. It is the coded integer primary key of the **IWDR Key**.
