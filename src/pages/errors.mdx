# Errors
<AuthChecker />

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when something goes wrong while you&apos;re working with the IWDR API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can tell if your request was successful by checking the "success" field when receiving an API response.
If a response comes back unsuccessful, you will see the "success" field marked as the boolean value false,
and the "error" field will contain the exact error message
to figure out what has gone wrong in order to do some rudimentary debugging
(before contacting support).

## Status codes

Here is a list of status codes returned by the IWDR API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

<Properties>
  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response from the IWDR api.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error - Generally authentication based.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error - Something could possbily be wrong with your data.
  </Property>
